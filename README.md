Timeline:

* On 2024-02-16 19:38Z I forked this from [Deskasoft/Data.HashFunction](https://github.com/Deskasoft/Data.HashFunction).
* At 2024-02-17 03:50Z I realized I only needed a tiiiiiny bit of it for Murmurhash instead of the entire project, which needs probably hours of time to modernize it for .NET 7+
* At 2024-02-17 03:52Z I archived this repo on GitHub and regret the wasted effort on it. Le sigh.
